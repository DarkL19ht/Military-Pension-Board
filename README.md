## Note

-   createdBy is returning "1" while admin table UI expect "name" to be displayed
-   The getRole endpoints is paginated which is fine but when using the roles in a select
    dropdown field, it is expected that all role should be fetch. The usual convention is to pass "size=0" to get all roles but that's not working. so what is the queryParams to be pass to get all
    roles.
-   After successfully updating a user profile page, there is no way to invalidate the endpoint, to get the updated user information
- for user profile update, what is expected to be pass as status since there is not status in the token
- for user profile update, endpoint expect array of roleId, while token contain array of role as string
- after successful updating a user password, what is the expectation ? logout the user or what ?
